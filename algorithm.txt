For each intersection:
    Maintain a queue of of all the streets and the cars waiting on each street
    
    For each light:
        Calculate how many cars you'd prevent from going through by letting this light be green
         - 
    Pick the light with the smallest number ^

For each car:
    Keep track of where it is on the road
    when it is 1 second away from the intersection, add it to the queue list for the intersection it's approaching
    the street it's on and the street length
    how far along is it on the road (x seconds)
    how far does it have to move to cross the road (L - x seconds)
